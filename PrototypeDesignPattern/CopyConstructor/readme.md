# Prototype Design Pattern - Copy Constructor

In Java, private attributes are accessible within the same class. The copy() method is part of the Student class, so it can access the private fields directly. When you call original.copy() in the Client class, you are simply invoking the copy() method, which is allowed to access and copy the private fields because it's within the same class. The Client class never directly accesses these private fields; it only receives a Student object that has already been set up by copy().

This is how it works:

In the Student class, the copy() method creates a new Student instance and assigns the values of the private attributes from this (the current object) to the new copy object.
When you call original.copy() in the Client class, the copy() method executes and returns a new Student instance with the same private attributes as the original.
The Client class now has a copy, but it doesnâ€™t need direct access to the private attributes; it simply gets a new Student object with copied values.
This approach is common in the Prototype design pattern, where objects create their own copies without exposing their internals directly.
